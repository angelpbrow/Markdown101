 Markdown, MarkDown 
======

We have Mr. Gruber to thank for placing a human face in front of our code. The Markdown language is a great first impression to end-users who may not understand what the code is but will know the **why** behind it. The language is a darling of developers around the world for these reasons:

* **Markdown** is very simple to write.
* **Markdown** is just darn lovely to look at.
* **Markdown's** ability to be store and edited in git repos.

Now, a word from the man himself:

Thank you, Gruber. I did not know that. But do you know about Poe[https://cdn.britannica.com/52/76652-050-F4A6B093/Edgar-Allan-Poe.jpg]?

### All poems

1. are thought-provoking
     * Sometimes.
2. make you think
    * I hope.
3. AIs are weird
    * And liars.
4. Poe's poems _rock!_
     * **The Goth King**


# The Raven

_Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
At my door was a one whose presence is quite dreary 
The Ice Man!
Dastardly foe of mine came knocking
    rap rap rapping
On my highly security surveillanced door
I looked at my Ring cam video and yelped
**NEVERMORE!**
Do not come my way and set your block of ice on my doorstep!
It's 2025. I have refrigerators that keep my spinach at most fresh.
Begone from here or I'll inform the gents 
With flashing beacons on their cars and who will rent
You to pieces._
